## Welcome to `shadcn-collections`

**shadcn-collections** is a curated set of UI components built on top of the awesome [`shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/).  
But here’s the twist — every component here is customized, refined, and tailored to solve **real-world problems**.

Whether you’re building a dashboard, launching a product, or just experimenting — this collection is designed to help you build faster without compromising on design or flexibility.

### 👋 A Note From Me

This project is built by **Sanku** (yup, that’s me 👋).  
These components are actually used in **my own projects**, so I thought — why not make them reusable and share them with the community?

If you spot an issue, see any bad practices, or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sankalpaacharya/shadcn-collections) or reach out directly.

I really appreciate your time here.  
**Thank you so much for visiting this.** 🙏

### 🧩 What You’ll Find Here

- 📦 **Copy-paste ready components**  
- 🎨 **Full ShadCN + Tailwind support**  
- 🛠️ **Custom tweaks and real-use improvements**  
- 💡 **Useful for SaaS, admin panels, landing pages, and more**

### ⚡ Why This Exists

ShadCN is amazing — but this collection builds on top of it with practical, styled, and slightly opinionated components you actually use in production.  
No generic boilerplate, no bloat — just beautiful, usable building blocks.
