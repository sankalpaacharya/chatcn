# Applications Manager

A command palette style application launcher inspired by macOS Spotlight and Windows search. Triggered by keyboard shortcut, it provides quick access to applications organized by category.

## Features

- **Keyboard Shortcut** - Open with `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+K` (Mac)
- **Category Groups** - Applications organized by category (Browsers, Social Media, etc.)
- **Search** - Filter applications by name
- **External Links** - Opens applications in new tabs

## Installation

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply render the component anywhere in your app. It will listen for the keyboard shortcut globally:

```tsx
import { ApplicationManager } from "@/components/chatcn/system/applications-manager"

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <main>Your app content</main>
      <ApplicationManager />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### In a Layout

Add to your root layout to make it available throughout your application:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { ApplicationManager } from "@/components/chatcn/system/applications-manager"

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <ApplicationManager />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

## How It Works

1. Press `Ctrl+K` or `⌘+K` to open the command palette
2. Type to search for applications
3. Use arrow keys or mouse to navigate
4. Press Enter or click to open the selected application
5. Press Escape or click outside to close

## Customization

To customize the available applications, modify the `applications` object in the component source file. Applications are organized by category:

```tsx
const applications: Record<string, Application[]> = {
  "Category Name": [
    {
      name: "App Name",
      icon: "https://path-to-icon.svg",
      url: "https://app-url.com",
    },
  ],
}
```

## Props

This component doesn't accept any props. It uses internal state management and automatically handles:

- Keyboard shortcut detection
- Dialog open/close state
- Application selection and navigation
