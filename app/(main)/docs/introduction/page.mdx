# Introduction

**shadcn-collections** is a set of customizable, high-quality components built for modern web applications, making it easy to design chat interfaces, content displays, interactive forms, and more, quickly and beautifully.

shadcn-collections is built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) with the same design principles. But instead of helping you build a component library, it helps you build specialized application interfaces.

## What's Inside

Our registry includes **16 specialized components** organized by category:

**Communication** — Message, Chat Container, Thread, Thought  
**Input** — Prompt Input, Prompt Suggestion  
**Content** — Code Block, Code Editor, Markdown, Source  
**Data** — Calendar, Weather, File, Tool  
**Layout** — Command Tabs, Shadow Scrollbar

## Getting Started

Install any component with a single command:

<CodeBlock lang="bash">{`npx shadcn@latest add https://shadcn-collections.vercel.app/c/[component-name]`}</CodeBlock>
