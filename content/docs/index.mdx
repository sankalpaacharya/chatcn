**chatcn** is a set of UI components built using the awesome [`shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/).  
But with a little twist each one is tweaked, styled, and shaped based on things I actually needed in my own projects.

Whether you’re hacking together a dashboard, trying out an idea, or just building for fun — I hope these help you move faster and skip the boring setup stuff.

### A Note From Me

Hey, I’m **Sanku**  and yeah, I built this.  
These components come straight out of the stuff I’ve been building, so I figured: why not clean them up and share them with others?

If you spot something off, have an idea, or just wanna say hi — you can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sankalpaacharya/chatcn) or reach out directly.

Really means a lot that you’re checking this out.  
Thanks for being here.

- Works with ShadCN + Tailwind  
- Some tweaks to make them nicer to use  
- Good for dashboards, side projects, landing pages, and more

### Why I Made This

ShadCN is already great — this just adds my own spin based on what I needed while building stuff.  
Not too fancy, not too bloated — just stuff I wish I had when I started.
